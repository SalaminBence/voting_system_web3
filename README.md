🧩 PROJECT OVERVIEW
Goal: Build a decentralized application that allows users to create proposals, vote on them, and view results on-chain.

📅 Sprint Structure Assumptions
Assuming:

2-week sprints

1 full-stack dev (or a small team)

MVP (Minimal Viable Product) in 2–3 sprints

🧱 EPICS & USER STORIES
We’ll break this into 3 main epics, with corresponding tasks/user stories under FE and BE categories:

🧩 EPIC 1: Smart Contract Development (Solidity)
Focused on creating and testing the voting logic.

🔧 Backend Tasks (Sprint 1):
Task	Description	Story Points
1.1 Write Proposal Struct	Define what a proposal is: title, description, vote count, etc.	2
1.2 Implement Voting Smart Contract	Add functions: createProposal(), vote(), getProposals()	5
1.3 Restrict Voting	Add modifiers to allow only 1 vote per address	3
1.4 Contract Testing (Hardhat/Foundry)	Write unit tests to ensure logic integrity	5
1.5 Deploy to Testnet	Deploy smart contract on a testnet (e.g., Sepolia)	3

🧩 EPIC 2: Frontend UI & Web3 Integration
Build the interface in React and connect to the contract using Ethers.js or Wagmi.

🎨 Frontend Tasks (Sprint 2):
Task	Description	Story Points
2.1 Setup React App	Create project, install deps (ethers.js, wagmi, tailwind, etc.)	2
2.2 Connect Wallet	Integrate MetaMask using wagmi or ethers.js	3
2.3 Display Proposals	Fetch and list proposals from the smart contract	5
2.4 Voting Form	Allow users to vote on a selected proposal	3
2.5 Create Proposal Form	Optional — Allow creating new proposals (if permissioned)	3
2.6 Display Results	Show vote counts and winning proposal	3

🧩 EPIC 3: Polish, QA & Deployment
Final sprint for refinement, security checks, and UI polish.

⛏️ Tasks (Sprint 3):
Task	Description	Story Points
3.1 Refactor Smart Contract	Improve gas usage, modularize	2
3.2 UI/UX Polish	Add success/failure notifications, loaders	3
3.3 Add Wallet Guardrails	Disable buttons when disconnected or already voted	2
3.4 Manual Testing	Check for edge cases, replay bugs	2
3.5 Deploy Frontend	Use Vercel or Netlify for the frontend	1

✅ SPRINT SUGGESTION
🔵 Sprint 1 (Smart Contract & Backend Focus)
Tasks: 1.1 – 1.5

Goal: Functional and tested smart contract deployed on testnet

🟢 Sprint 2 (Frontend Development)
Tasks: 2.1 – 2.6

Goal: Functional UI with vote submission and proposal listing

🟠 Sprint 3 (Integration & QA)
Tasks: 3.1 – 3.5

Goal: Fully functional dApp with error handling and polish

🔧 Tools Stack
Smart Contract: Solidity + Hardhat

Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind (or MUI)

Web3 Integration: Ethers.js or Wagmi + Viem

Testnet: Sepolia or Goerli

Deployment: Vercel (FE), Etherscan/Alchemy (BE)

Would you like me to scaffold the smart contract or set up the React app for you?
